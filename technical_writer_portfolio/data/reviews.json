        "text": "Chelsea has all of <br> the intelligence that one would expect of a graduate student at a major research institution, but she has other, arguably more important characteristics as well. She works hard, is timely with her work, and produces work of quality the first time. She is a good colleague and an excellent team member. Most importantly, perhaps, Chelsea has remarkable management skills and leadership potential. Her leadership ability, combined with her intelligence and hard work, make valuable and the primary reasons why she has been effective for us."
