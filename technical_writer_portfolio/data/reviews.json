        "text": "Chelsea has all of the intelligence that one would expect of a graduate student at a major research institution, but she has other, arguably more important characteristics as well. She works hard, is timely with her work, and produces work of quality the first time. She is a good colleague and an excellent team member. Most importantly, perhaps, Chelsea has remarkable management skills and leadership potential. Her leadership ability, combined with her intelligence and hard work, make valuable and the primary reasons why she has been effective for us."

        "text": "In my two decades in the aviation field, both Military and Civilian, I have learned a few things about teamwork and collaboration. Even the best laid plans will go nowhere without the right individuals that can work together in a seamless manner that allows everyone’s strength to rise up, while helping minimize weaknesses. Chelsea is the glue that your team needs to effectively work as one to accomplish the task at hand. I have never met a more dedicated and enthusiastic leader in my career. Without Chelsea during the past three years at Delta Air Lines, I have no doubt that our projects would not have been the high caliber pilot training programs they became.<br> Chelsea is the rare breed of individual that can be put into any situation, with any group of people, and will find a way to succeed. This level of leadership could never be taught, as it requires personality traits that very few possess. Taking these traits and combining them with a work ethic and desire to always do the absolute best is the formula needed to be successful. There is no project that Chelsea could not complete, on time, and with results that exceed all expectations. I have no doubt that any obstacle in her way will be overcome, and any organization that is lucky enough to have her on their team will be better for it."

Equally evident are Chelsea’s collaboration, networking, and communication skills, which are truly beyond comparison.<br> She has the ability to manage multiple cross-functional, large-scale projects in a way that allows the collaborating SMEs to focus on their area of expertise.<br> Chelsea’s work is consistently ahead of schedule, while encompassing extremely high-quality and bulletproof assurance.<br> The materials she has produced for our department are often offered as an example for other aircraft fleets to emulate."
