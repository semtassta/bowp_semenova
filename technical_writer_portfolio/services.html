                    opportunity and pleasure of working with Chelsea.<br>
                    From day one, it was clear that Chelsea is a uniquely talented technical writer and exceptional
                    instructional designer. Equally evident are Chelsea’s collaboration, networking, and communication
                    skills, which are truly beyond comparison.<br>
                    She has the ability to manage multiple cross-functional, large-scale projects in a way that allows
                    the collaborating SMEs to focus on their area of expertise.<br>
                    Chelsea’s work is consistently ahead of schedule, while encompassing extremely high-quality and
                    bulletproof assurance.<br>
                    The materials she has produced for our department are often offered as an example for other aircraft
                    fleets to emulate.</p>

                    a major research institution, but she has other, arguably more important characteristics as well.
                    She works hard, is timely with her work, and produces work of quality the first time. She is a good
                    colleague and an excellent team member. Most importantly, perhaps, Chelsea has remarkable management
                    skills and leadership potential. Her leadership ability, combined with her intelligence and hard
                    work, make valuable and the primary reasons why she has been effective for us.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">In my two decades in the aviation field, both Military and Civilian, I have learned
                    a few things about teamwork and collaboration. Even the best laid plans will go nowhere without the
                    right individuals that can work together in a seamless manner that allows everyone’s strength to
                    rise up, while helping minimize weaknesses. Chelsea is the glue that your team needs to effectively
                    work as one to accomplish the task at hand. I have never met a more dedicated and enthusiastic
                    leader in my career. Without Chelsea during the past three years at Delta Air Lines, I have no doubt
                    that our projects would not have been the high caliber pilot training programs they became.<br>
                    Chelsea is the rare breed of individual that can be put into any situation, with any group of
                    people, and will find a way to succeed. This level of leadership could never be taught, as it
                    requires personality traits that very few possess. Taking these traits and combining them with a
                    work ethic and desire to always do the absolute best is the formula needed to be successful. There
                    is no project that Chelsea could not complete, on time, and with results that exceed all
                    expectations. I have no doubt that any obstacle in her way will be overcome, and any organization
                    that is lucky enough to have her on their team will be better for it.</p>
